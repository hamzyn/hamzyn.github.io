I woke to feel an ice cold sharpness of a sword stinging the front of my neck. As I strained my eyes through the misty darkness I could make out pale, thin hands grasping the hilt of the blade at the edge of my vision. A thin man? Possibly a woman, but the arm was covered and the body behind me, obscured from my view.

Quickly, I grasped the tip of the blade with two fingers, pushing it away from my neck before he could cut any deeper. The attacker pushed, but I straightened out my arm until it was outstretched.

Judging from the strength, it _was_ a female. How amusing. Slowly, I brought my legs up from their previous lying down position, and moved my back away from the tree I had been leaning on.

As I peered to my left I could barely make out the grip that my assailant used to hold his sword. One hand on top, another a few inches below. One and pointed up, the other down. Pressure being mainly applied on the lower fingers of the dominant hand. I stared at the blade itself. Completely still.

I sighed quietly, dismayed by my apparent misfortune. Great. A professional.

Or at least someone proficient in the sword. I hear that in the east they use bamboo swords for sparring and as a sport. Looking again at the hand, I could just make out a tinge of yellow on the complexion. So, from the east.

The sword was pointed at the base of my neck, and had cut about 2cm in. a true professional would know to cut at the upper part of the neck.

I relaxed. At least not a pro. His blade was slightly curved, and had a circular guards. A black hilt, with minimal pattern. Probably an early Japanese Tachi, further confirming my suspicions.

Seeing this, my assailant struggled, attempting the release her blade from my grip. Her struggles were in vain. I tightened my grip on the metal, knowing that its release would mean a relatively serious injury to me. I scanned the surroundings, searching for a tree amongst the forest that would be quickest to climb. I found it in the form of a vine hanging from a tree to my right, penetrating the dense vegetation.

&quot;So, why is some random Japanese girl pointing her blade at _me?_&quot; My casually spoken question echoed through the humid atmosphere.

The girl slackened her force on the blade, surprised by my foresight. No doubt she was probably also wearing a mask in an attempt to hide her identity. Hence her consternation. After all, I had a reputation.

I seized the opportunity, pushing the blade upwards whilst ducking down and rolling to the right. A split second later the blade smashed with a loud thud into the tree. I risked a glance back, and saw a black-masked figure attempting to force her sword half of the way into the tree.

Halfway. Whoa. Impressive. The tree in particular had a painfully hard bark to lean on as well. Furthermore, judging from her height, she seems to be about fifteen. Hmm. This girl has potential to be a future member.

I rushed onto my feet, before desperately diving towards the vine. It&#39;s not that I was particularly fearful for my life; I still had my prized (and expensive) black wakizashi at my waist, as well as an AUS-10 Tanto and an Applegate-Fairbairn in my black jacket. I doubt that some cut-price tachi can kill me. But even so. I don&#39;t want to dull my blades in the gut of some inexperienced kid.

_And_ I was in a rush. I had to be back at base by morning with the report of my successful outing, or Suhaila would go crazy. Hmph. Well screw her.

I put my weight on the vine, and put my feet on the tree. Glancing back, the girl has _already_ freed her sword and is charging towards me with full aplomb.

Quickly, I started climbing the crooked trunk, utilising the vine as a makeshift support. My assailant quickly followed, scampering up a nearby tree like a monkey.

As I looked upwards, I could see the ceiling of leaves approach me, becoming closer and closer. The forest was dead silent, save for my attacker&#39;s heavy breathing.

Nearing the uppermost leaves, I risked a glance down. The girl was struggling fifteen meters below me, but the distance was closing fast. I considered. She _did_ have potential, and we _do_ need a new memberâ€¦

I sighed. Reaching into the innermost pockets of my jacket, I withdrew a small black carry knife, only 3 inches in length. I also took out a small dark red piece of paper. Our business card.

Hastily I sliced a small hole through the card, and quickly tied it to the knife with a leaf. I glanced back. She was only seven meters away.

Seeing my glance, she looked in my direction, her expression hidden beneath that black mask. Her eyes glared at me, a piercing dark brown. I winked cheerily.

Suddenly, a black 3 inch knife sprouted from the forehead of the mask. I saw her eyes widen in shock, before she tumbled soundlessly to the leaf-covered floor 30 meters below.

Hopefully she didn&#39;t die. That potential was too much to waste. I looked down one final time, before ascending past the thick roof of leaves, into the shining glow of the moon.

I glanced at my watch. 4 hours left till sunrise. Crap. Staring into the black horizon, I leapt from tree to tree, heading towards base.
